This repository is just for descriptions and video links of my projects.

Prime Engine: 
University of Southern California, Fall 2016
Implemented bounding volume and culling, and a physics system with collision detection. 
Implemented a particle system with collision, managed a single vertex buffer and index buffer to store all particles, and did all computations with DX11 compute shader on GPU.

Spark: 
University of Southern California, Fall 2016
Built stationary and moving enemies with chase and shoot AI and various moves.
Implemented a curved wall generator that generate curved wall mesh based with sample points and tangent data.

As shown in the video, all curved walls all generated with my wall generator. The wall take in a few sample points with tangent data to interpolate and generate a curved wall mesh. 
Vertex buffer, index buffer, normals, and uv(texture coordinate) buffer were all generated.

Gravity Racer:
University of Southern California, Winter 2016
Developed a procedural generation algorithm to generate random racing tracks. The algorithm recycles a list of tracks mesh and generate tracks in front of the player on the fly by changing the vertex buffer of each mesh.

Two Buttons Left: 
Syracuse University, Fall 2015
Implemented an event system for text-based game with a lot of dialogues and branches.

Open Source Project: Simplified GFS: 
Sun Yat-Sen University, Spring 2014
Implemented a simplified version in C/C++ of the Google File System which is a distributed file system with client, master server, and chunk server based on the paper The Google File System.
